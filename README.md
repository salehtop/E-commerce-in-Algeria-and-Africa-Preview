📌 Project Overview

This repository provides a public preview of my full ecommerce data analysis project. It contains a simplified version of the RStudio project, selected R Markdown code, limited data insights, and an HTML report.
Its purpose is to demonstrate my workflow, analysis approach, and reporting style without exposing the full proprietary datasets and complete project files.
